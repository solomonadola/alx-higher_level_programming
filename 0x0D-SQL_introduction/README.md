## What's a Database

A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It provides a systematic way to store, manage, and retrieve information.

## What's a Relational Database

A relational database is a type of database that uses a tabular structure to organize data into rows and columns. It establishes relationships between tables, enabling efficient querying and data retrieval.

## What Does SQL Stand For

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

## What's MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. It is widely used for building scalable and robust databases in various applications.

## How to Create a Database in MySQL

To create a database in MySQL, use the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

## What Does DDL and DML Stand For

- **DDL:** Data Definition Language. It includes SQL commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`, used for defining and managing database structure.
  
- **DML:** Data Manipulation Language. It includes SQL commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, used for manipulating data stored in the database.

## How to CREATE or ALTER a Table

To create a table in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

To alter a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN new_column datatype;
```

## How to SELECT Data from a Table

To select data from a table:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE Data

- **INSERT:**

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

- **UPDATE:**

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

- **DELETE:**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## What Are Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested within another query. It can be used to retrieve data that will be used by the main query as a condition or to perform operations.

## How to Use MySQL Functions

MySQL provides various built-in functions for performing operations on data. For example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
